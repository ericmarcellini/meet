# Objective:
To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven
development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch
upcoming events.
 
# Meet App

Meet App is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to showcase events happening in the world of programming. Users can browse through a list of events, view detailed information about each event, and gain insights through various visualizations such as a circle diagram representing the percentage of events by programming language and a graph showing events per country.

## Features

1. **Event Listings**:
   - Each event is displayed in a neatly styled box.
   - Users can click on a button within each box to view more detailed information about the event.

2. **Programming Language Distribution**:
   - A circle diagram (pie chart) shows the percentage of total events for each programming language.

3. **Events by City**:
   - A graph displays the number of events per city, providing a geographical distribution of programming events.
